1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,440
Oh no, this is a title that makes me

2
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,759
want to read it because again biases

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,679
confirming my biases. Also, last week I

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,759
did a full seven days in the tower doing

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,519
nothing but vibe coding with cursor and

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:15,679
also regular coding and also complaining

7
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
about AIS and then also loving tab. Very

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
complicated relationship right now. But

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:21,439
I have a problem here. April 1st. I

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,960
don't know where this is going to go.

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,640
Like is this going to be a good article

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,240
or is this going to be another article

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,119
in which I get sad about reading because

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:32,000
it's April 1st. Let's find out. TLDDR. I

15
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,079
choose to make using AI a manual action

16
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,760
because I felt the slow loss of

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,600
competence over time when I relied on it

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,200
and I recommend everyone to be cautious

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,399
with making AI a key part of their

20
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,840
workflow. I still think I'm going to get

21
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,680
I still think I'm going to get AI uh

22
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,800
what's it called? April fooled here any

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,440
moment. Here we go. We're going to get

24
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,640
ready. Uh in the late 2022, I used AI

25
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,719
tools for the first time. Even before

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,800
the first version of Chad Jippity uh in

27
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:54,640
2023, by the way, the first time using

28
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,840
Copilot, I still remember. I still I I

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
talk about this all the time is the

30
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,440
magic moment. Magic moment. Absolutely

31
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
magic. One of the best moments I've ever

32
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,680
had. Very, very magic. In 2023, I

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,040
started using AI based tools in my

34
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,479
development workflow. Initially, I was

35
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,560
super impressed with the capabilities of

36
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,320
LLMs. The fact that I could just copy

37
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,400
and paste obscure compiler errors along

38
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,040
with C++ source code and be told where

39
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:17,680
the error is cause uh caused felt like

40
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,479
magic. Yeah. Yeah, that does feel like

41
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,000
magic because forget C++ errors. Yo. Yo,

42
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:24,720
if there's one thing I hate more in life

43
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,560
than C++ errors, it's signing into my

44
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,720
terminal, right? Like there's few things

45
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,960
I hate more, but that's one of them. Um,

46
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,479
once GitHub Copilot started becoming

47
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,560
more and more powerful, I started using

48
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,479
it more and more. I used various other

49
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,560
LLM integrations right in my editor,

50
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,320
using AI as a part of my workflow. I do

51
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,799
want to say though that GitHub Copilot

52
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,400
sucks. It just does. It's not good. It's

53
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,720
not been good. It's not being good. It's

54
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,479
not looking good. It doesn't feel good.

55
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,280
It doesn't make me happy. It's just

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,920
mostly bad. It predicts many two lines.

57
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,360
It's often just gross. It's just wrong.

58
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,560
But I've been converted. I've always

59
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,200
said I've always said this for a long

60
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:01,759
time. I think the best AI coding like

61
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:03,280
assist isn't these question and asking

62
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,520
vibe coding approaches. I think they're

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,560
just horrible. The best assist is a

64
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:11,200
really good autocomplete. And before I

65
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,120
ever even used cursor, I we were I even

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,000
kind of made my own little quick version

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,080
in uh VS or Vim just to kind of feel how

68
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,200
it would be in a neoim feel what it was.

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,760
And I was like, "Okay, that's pretty

70
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
cool." But then when I use cursor, it

71
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,239
actually has such a good version of

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,160
copilot. Their version of copilot tab is

73
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:30,480
so good. It's totally worth at least

74
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,319
giving a try, but your skills will

75
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,599
immediately atrophy. It's always the

76
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:34,959
problem about offloading stuff. The

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,560
moment you offload, you just don't think

78
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,319
about things as more. Anyways, in the

79
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,920
late 2024, I removed all LLM

80
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,680
integrations for my code editors. I

81
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,040
still use LLM occasionally, and I do not

82
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,560
think AI can be used in a way that is

83
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,920
very beneficial for many

84
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,760
programmers. Generally agree. So then

85
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,319
why don't I use AI powered code editing

86
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:57,519
tools? Uh Tesla FSD from 2019 to 2021 I

87
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:59,440
drove a Tesla. Bros just out there just

88
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
telling you what he's driving flexing on

89
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,440
us kids. 2019 Tesla days. Those are

90
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,040
pretty popular days a Tesla. Though I

91
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,560
would never make the same purchase

92
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,800
again. Not for political reasons, just

93
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,280
because the cars are quite low quality,

94
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
very overpriced, and a hell to repair or

95
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,480
maintain. Yeah, I've heard the I've

96
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,080
heard the repairing is insane. By the

97
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:20,400
way, when I was in the Bay Area, like

98
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:22,400
the 2014, 2015, 2019, it was a flexa to

99
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,840
have a Tesla, right? When I got my

100
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,000
Tesla, I started using the full

101
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,319
self-driving FSD anytime I could. It

102
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,920
felt great just to put the car on FSD on

103
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,519
the highway and zone out a bit.

104
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,200
Switching lanes was as simple as hitting

105
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:35,280
the turn signal, and the car would

106
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,599
switch lanes. Driving for me was getting

107
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,200
to the highway, turning on FSD, telling

108
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,799
the car to switch lanes every now and

109
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,959
then, and listen to music and podcasts

110
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,440
while zoning out. If you drive a car

111
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,599
often, you'll know that when you're

112
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,519
driving on the highway, everything sort

113
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,280
uh sort of happens automatically.

114
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,120
Keeping your car in the lane at the

115
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:55,040
right speed becomes a passive action. It

116
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
does not require the type of focus that,

117
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,799
for example, reading a book requires.

118
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,720
It's the same type of focus that walking

119
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,760
requires. It happens in the background

120
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,400
of your mind. Fair. It's just really

121
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,159
annoying. So far, he's making a great

122
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:10,959
case for me to want to get a

123
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,040
self-driving car. I hate driving. I just

124
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,280
hate driving. Driving is hypnosis, dude.

125
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,759
It's Dude,

126
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,840
it's In the period of from 2019 to 2021,

127
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,759
I exclusively drove my Tesla for longer

128
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,520
rides. After 2021, I went back to

129
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,720
driving regular cars, and making the

130
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,479
switch was definitely not what I

131
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,320
expected. Driving on the highway

132
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,320
required my full attention for the first

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,759
uh for the first month or so. I had to

134
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,520
relearn keeping the car in the middle of

135
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,000
the lane without thinking about it.

136
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Being reliant on Tesl Tesla's FSD took

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,520
away my own ability to go into

138
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:41,360
autopilot. Okay, that's actually an

139
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
interesting argument. So I think the

140
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,800
argument he's trying to make is that

141
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:49,360
tasks in which we do regularly become

142
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,280
background tasks like walking. There's a

143
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
lot of like hidden things that you do

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,199
that you don't realize you're doing or

145
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,759
the calculations that are required that

146
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:59,800
your body just does naturally for you.

147
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,560
And if you take that ability to do that

148
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,880
away, the natural easy thing that used

149
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,360
to be easy becomes hard. Okay, that's a

150
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,960
good Hey, it's a good it's a it's a very

151
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,560
good basis to build a good argument. I

152
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,680
think I think this is Yeah, literally

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,199
muscle memory. Well, it's actually like

154
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
spinal memory to be completely fair.

155
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,479
Everyone talk about it, but uh this is

156
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,320
actually a really I think this is

157
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,000
actually a pretty great basis for an

158
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,360
argument. My experience with AI code

159
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,960
editors working with AI powered code

160
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,520
editors was somewhat similar. Initially,

161
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,840
I felt that I was comp uh I completed

162
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,199
work a lot faster when assisted by AI.

163
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,880
The work I was doing most of the time

164
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,280
was not super complex and AI felt like

165
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,479
putting my Tesla on FSD. I could just

166
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,919
guide the machine to do the work for me.

167
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,440
Yeah. Yeah. In my free time, I started

168
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,600
working on side projects on my personal

169
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,800
account on my work device. Uh on this

170
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,360
account, I did not have access to

171
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,280
copilot and other cool fancy AI tools.

172
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,360
This is when using AI started to feel

173
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,120
very similar to te uh the Tesla FSD

174
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,880
story. Yeah. Now that I got done using

175
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,120
cursor for a week, honestly, going back

176
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:57,039
to Neil Vim, sometimes I'm uh sometimes

177
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,759
I'm in here and when I start going here

178
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:02,080
and I go like this. All right. Uh or I

179
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,600
go uh param and I'm like gosh just

180
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,120
autocomp completed already for me. Yeah,

181
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,600
I have a snippet but then I have to go

182
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,759
like number and I have to go number and

183
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,600
then I have to like go number, right? Oh

184
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,880
my gosh, just I already know what you

185
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,319
want. You know what I want? I know what

186
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,000
I want. Just make it happen, right? And

187
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,319
if I use co-pilot, I could get that back

188
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,440
on. But co-pilot's also super annoying

189
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,440
everywhere else cuz copilot's like

190
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,800
actually. And it's always wrong like 95%

191
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,880
of the time it feels like and just makes

192
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
me feel like I'm going to go bonkers. Oh

193
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,880
my gosh. It just I just want I just I

194
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,240
just hate I just hate using it. It's

195
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,720
like pair programming with the most

196
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,400
annoying person in the universe. Uh you

197
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,479
just get to see their thoughts just all

198
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
the time. All right. Anyways, I felt

199
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:43,039
less competent at doing what I was quite

200
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,039
basically software development than a

201
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:46,960
year or so before. All of a sudden, it

202
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,800
made very clear to me how reliant I had

203
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,280
become on AI tools. I don't think this

204
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,199
is a bad thing, right? Like I'm not sure

205
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,199
if it's a bad thing. I have to think

206
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,319
about this more, but I'm not quite

207
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,080
positive if the if just programming is

208
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,919
the end- all beall. I think that you

209
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,560
lose a lot of really keen sense of

210
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,560
what's going on when you don't type it

211
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:08,080
yourself. And I think that you lose a

212
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,919
lot of mastery and you lose a lot of

213
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,000
just like familiarity with the API and

214
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:14,880
you lose like but I could also argue

215
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,080
that LSP in some sense makes the exact

216
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:21,199
same thing happen that the LSP itself

217
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,199
also makes you lose some of that quality

218
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:25,599
that when it comes to being a really

219
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:27,440
good programmer. I think they're on a

220
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:28,960
near same level. Not quite. They're

221
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
they're like a different in they're a

222
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:32,960
different in magnitude not a difference

223
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,639
in kind. Uh anytime I defined a function

224
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,639
I paused in my editor to wait until the

225
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,160
AI tools would write the implementation

226
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,319
for me. It took some effort to remember

227
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,479
what the syntax was to write a unit test

228
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,919
by hand. Ah yes the old co-pilot pause.

229
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,520
So this is a real effect for those that

230
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:49,199
are using uh AI regularly. Try uh just

231
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,479
try writing without it for a second. Try

232
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,479
writing without copilot and you'll

233
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,879
realize that you just like stop and your

234
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,319
brain just like literally turns off. LSB

235
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,319
for faster navigation, by the way, is

236
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,000
very, very good. I like that. You like

237
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,599
literally turn off your brain and it's

238
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,440
just super annoying and you're like, why

239
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,039
am I turning it off all the time? Uh,

240
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,720
with my work, AI started to become less

241
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:09,199
useful over time as well. Not only did

242
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,800
it take out the uh out the fun for me,

243
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,160
but I started to feel a bit insecure

244
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,919
about making some implementation

245
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:15,680
decisions myself. Oh, interesting.

246
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,360
Outsourcing the decisions to the AI

247
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,440
seemed a lot easier, but sometimes the

248
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,599
AI couldn't figure things out even with

249
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,120
the best prompts. uh it was quite clear

250
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,520
that because I did not practice the

251
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,280
basics often I was less capable with the

252
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:30,479
harder parts as well. So this actually

253
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:33,519
was an argument within um the there was

254
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,120
a paper by Microsoft and Carnegie Melon

255
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,399
about the effects of turning off

256
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,919
critical thinking and uh using AI and

257
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
they made this really great argument. I

258
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:45,040
forget what the there's an author that

259
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,800
talks about to do the hard things

260
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,920
requires you to do the easy things

261
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:52,000
millions of times. And so one of their

262
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,800
kind of core arguments of the paper was

263
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,839
that by stopping doing the easy things,

264
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:59,120
the harder things become harder, which

265
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:01,600
is actually a pretty interesting

266
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,680
argument. The paper took literally 30

267
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,399
pages to say like a two sentence to say

268
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:09,959
two sentences. It was absolutely

269
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:13,760
mind-numbing to read, right? It was

270
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:16,080
like but it was like a really uh it

271
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,000
comes from Whitehead. It comes it's

272
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,080
actually let's see it's an old argument.

273
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,760
And it comes from Whitehead. Uh well,

274
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,839
the real analysis of it. Yeah. So,

275
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:25,920
there's like this idea that if you don't

276
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,200
make a thousand little decisions that

277
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,640
are easy, you're not going to be able to

278
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,839
make one hard decision. And that's all

279
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:34,080
there is to it. And it's it he's kind of

280
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
I think he's saying that without saying

281
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,279
that

282
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:40,240
uh with my work, AI started to become

283
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:44,800
less Oh, I already read that. Uh the

284
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:48,320
loss of finger uh finger spits and goil

285
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,399
uh finger spits and goil. Yeah. is a jam

286
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,800
and term literally meaning fingertips

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,360
feeling. Oh yeah, the feelings go feel

288
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,880
and meaning intuitive flare or instinct

289
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,600
which has been adopted by the English

290
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:01,200
language as a lone word. It describes a

291
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,120
great situational awareness and the

292
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,120
ability to respond most appropriately

293
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:07,440
and tactfully. Interesting. So it's like

294
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,800
a it's like a form it's like a form of

295
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,000
muscle memory but in the realm of

296
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,760
competency. To play an instrument very

297
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,240
fast, the only way to play it uh is to

298
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,240
play very slow in repetition over time.

299
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,839
I think this is I think this often with

300
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,000
AI plus programming. Interesting. Yeah,

301
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:23,519
finger

302
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:27,120
feel. We do we just call is this what we

303
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:29,680
call uh muscle memory otherwise known as

304
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,440
touch in the NFL? Yeah, finesse. And I

305
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:33,279
think in sports ball we call it finesse.

306
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,959
Who who no one uses this word. I think

307
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,880
we just call it finesse. Right. Hey

308
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
finger spits. Thank you. The only way to

309
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,040
chop fast is to start chopping slowly.

310
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:43,200
Yes. Correct. Defing seniority is a very

311
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,360
tough thing. Though in my opinion, a lot

312
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:46,720
of being a senior is in soft skills.

313
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,200
When it comes to the technical hard

314
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:52,240
skills, a lot comes down to finger

315
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,000
spits. I don't even know how to say that

316
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,600
word. The longer you work with a

317
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,440
language framework or codebase, the more

318
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,440
you develop this kind of intuition of

319
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,560
what the correct approach is. Yeah, I

320
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,760
think that's all true, right? Like

321
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,839
anyone who's worked in a larger

322
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:05,920
codebase, it's like mysterious, large,

323
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,839
and annoying at first and becomes easier

324
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:09,680
and nicer as time goes on and then

325
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:11,279
eventually it becomes easy to work in.

326
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,720
And then soon you're off running fast.

327
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,079
And that's just like, you know, we I

328
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,600
think people often can call that thing

329
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:16,880
like tribal knowledge. People try to say

330
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,079
you need to document everything, but

331
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:20,000
there's a certain level of documentation

332
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,480
that just stops working. Like you just

333
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,240
can't do it. It no longer works in that

334
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,440
realm. It's like, yeah, intuition, it's

335
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:27,519
good. It's a good thing. It feels good

336
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,519
to be an expert at something. Um, the

337
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:31,519
gut feeling of something feels off

338
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,680
slowly turns into a feeling of this is

339
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:35,600
what we should do. This developed

340
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,760
intuition is not just an architectural

341
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,360
level level. A big component is in the

342
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:41,120
lower level details. When you use

343
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,760
pointers or what type of pointers,

344
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,440
whether you use asserts or checks, what

345
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,120
to pick from the standard library when

346
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,959
multiple options are available. Those

347
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,200
senior C++ programmers still can't seem

348
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:53,120
to agree on this. This intuition is what

349
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,600
I was slowly losing when relying on AI

350
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,760
tools a lot. And this is coming from a

351
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,160
lead developer. When I see a lot of hype

352
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:02,240
about vibe coding, I can't help but

353
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,480
think, how do you exactly expect to vibe

354
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,800
code your way to a senior? Where where

355
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,639
will you get the skills? uh from to

356
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,720
maintain and extend the vibe coding code

357
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,880
base when the AI tools are down or have

358
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,079
become too expensive. I think I mean I

359
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:16,680
think there's probably a level of

360
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:18,880
intuition finger spits finger sprites

361
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:21,440
and there's a bit of finesse that

362
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:24,560
probably comes with uh prompts and

363
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:26,399
context that you also can probably grow

364
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,760
on when it comes to prompting. There are

365
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,760
people who are better at prompting than

366
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,240
me. Uh Cockorn, don't even try that with

367
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,399
me. Uh L take it's always becoming uh

368
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,920
it's always up and becoming cheaper. Uh

369
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:39,000
lately things haven't been cheaper.

370
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,240
Okay, I'm just saying Jippy 45 is really

371
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:46,480
expensive. Okay, Sam Alman was promising

372
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:50,720
is promising me 10x cheaper per year and

373
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,760
6 months after he said that it got 100x

374
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:56,320
more expensive. Okay, this is stupid. I

375
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:58,240
want a 10x. Sam wouldn't lie, would he?

376
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,560
He did he did just get done raising 40

377
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:02,399
billion. So sure I'm now he's I'm sure

378
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,639
he's tweeting now like wow man this

379
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:06,240
shit's expensive. We got a lot of money

380
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,320
to fix these problems now. Don't you

381
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,320
worry. Eggs went up almost 10%. Yeah. Or

382
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,839
10x. Yeah. It's crazy. Uh even with

383
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:13,600
larger context windows, more computing

384
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:15,120
power, reasoning models or agents, there

385
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,560
will be things that AI won't be able to

386
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,160
do. Over time, the AI tools will get

387
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,399
more and more powerful. Sure. But when

388
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,320
you receive a Slack message that uh the

389
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:24,480
website works fine, but the app is down

390
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,399
in production. I tried locally and there

391
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,959
it works fine. Nothing in sensory

392
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:31,279
either. Good luck getting an a AI agent

393
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,440
to fix this for you. Maybe it can, maybe

394
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:35,440
it can't. And when the AI agent can't

395
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,519
figure it out, will you reply, "Sorry,

396
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,079
cursor doesn't get it. We'll uh we'll

397
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,079
prompt more

398
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,360
tomorrow." I do love that, David. Sorry.

399
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,000
We'll prompt again tomorrow. I'm kind of

400
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,519
out. I'm kind of, you know, my creative

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,800
prompt juices are kind of out for the

402
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,480
day, so I'm just going to prompt again

403
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,920
tomorrow. Okay, dude. That's such a

404
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,920
great phrase. I want to use this all the

405
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,760
time. You can get by without these

406
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:03,040
tools. Yeah, you most certainly can. Uh

407
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,440
people that say that like you're being

408
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:08,639
left behind, I think are incorrect. You

409
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,360
know, I haven't used tab or cursor until

410
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:14,880
just last week. And after using it just

411
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:17,279
for one moment, maybe like what an hour

412
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:19,519
and a half, I became a very big expert

413
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:21,279
at exactly how tab works and where it

414
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,639
works and why it works and when to use

415
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:26,480
it. And so it's just like I don't think

416
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,000
I just don't think there's like this

417
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:30,000
so-called barrier to entry where it's

418
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
like if you're not profiting now, you're

419
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,040
never profiting again. Okay, so you're

420
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,079
saying they're going to get better all

421
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:35,279
the time? Yeah, they're going to get

422
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,720
much better. We're going to get way more

423
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,680
integrated. It's going to be completely

424
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:42,120
different here in like three years.

425
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:45,920
Okay. So, what am I learning

426
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,560
now? Checkmate, atheist. Uh, you can get

427
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:50,720
by with these tools. Uh, you're late for

428
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,040
for things. Uh, sometimes it feels like

429
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,040
you have to use AI or be out of a job in

430
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,199
6 months. We've been hearing the 3 to 6

431
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,120
months away now story forever. Uh, over

432
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,839
two years at this point. Uh, when I got

433
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,360
my Tesla in 2019, I paid

434
00:15:02,839 --> 00:15:07,360
6400 for functionality that was supposed

435
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,279
to arrive in 3 to 6 months from now. And

436
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,120
the functionality is still not present

437
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:13,440
the way it was promised over five years

438
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:15,680
ago. Self-driving cars is like the

439
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,920
greatest look into the future. Look at

440
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:20,800
self-driving cars. We've been promised

441
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,880
self-driving cars for a long, long time.

442
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,720
Right now, it is unlikely that letting

443
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,120
AI do your coding work for larger

444
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,720
projects than a university project. When

445
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,560
working on legacy systems or larger

446
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:32,720
projects in enterprise or when you need

447
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,880
to work with a and consult a lot of

448
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:37,360
dependency internals like I do with

449
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:39,279
Unreal Engine, AI tools will often not

450
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,000
be able to make things work. When you

451
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,680
need to work with internal DSLs, uh

452
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
tools or frameworks, good luck getting

453
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:49,120
LLMs to generate uh useful output for

454
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,120
industries. You can't even use AI tools

455
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,040
at all for a multitude of reasons. Yeah,

456
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,120
first off, let's go backwards that list.

457
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,279
By the way, this is really important. If

458
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,639
you solely depend on this, you're like

459
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:04,160
not getting a job in medical, finance,

460
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:06,639
government, banking, like there's a

461
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:09,920
whole slew of industries that just like

462
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:11,120
AI not allowed, right? And I'm sure that

463
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,399
will change over time and things will

464
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,399
change and blah blah blah blah blah blah

465
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,680
blah blah blah, but right now like

466
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:19,199
that's just like a closed door for you.

467
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:21,680
So, it's a good thing to re recognize

468
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,680
and I don't know. Let's see. Uh, Goldman

469
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,279
is big on AI tools now for dev. Yeah.

470
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:26,880
And so that could change in banks, but

471
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:29,120
I'm not sure how fast or quick that's

472
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,720
going to change. Uh, second off, this is

473
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,480
really, really good. I think the biggest

474
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:35,720
takeaway you can take from this sentence

475
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:42,160
is stop making DSLs. Just use

476
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:45,519
Lua. Just Lua. Lua easy, DSL hard. Every

477
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,360
time I make DSL, I make sad. Like that's

478
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,880
it. That's it. That's it. That's that's

479
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,880
all that's all I have to say for that.

480
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,040
For some things, you really should not

481
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:55,680
want to rely on AI when implementing

482
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,360
authentication systems like JWT signing

483
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,120
uh or RBAC. Adding uh and it should be

484
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,800
secure to the prompt won't make it

485
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,720
secure if it's been trained on GitHub

486
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,480
code that had CVEEs. By the way, there's

487
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
an if statement in here that's not

488
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,520
useful and also is a very very exciting

489
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:14,880
part about the future. Security is going

490
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,039
to be a very needed field for a long

491
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
time because the reality is where is

492
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:21,520
this code coming from? It's coming from

493
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:24,079
GitHub. Where are we discovering all

494
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,760
these security issues? They're always in

495
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,760
software that is open source that people

496
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,280
use. Why? That's because like security

497
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:31,120
issues are just a natural part of

498
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:32,559
programming. So, if everything's trained

499
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:34,000
on this, what's going to happen? It's

500
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,600
just going to make more of it. It's just

501
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,600
going to replicate it. Statistically

502
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,280
speaking, it makes security problems for

503
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:41,200
you. Everybody's just stealing my

504
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,360
terrible code. Uh, when it comes to

505
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,799
security, you should be the person who

506
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,640
is responsible and understands this

507
00:17:44,799 --> 00:17:48,080
fully. Critical systems should be

508
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:50,960
written and reviewed by humans. here.

509
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:54,160
Actually, a great example. NextJS last

510
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,440
security uh bug. This was just up here.

511
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,039
Where was it? Their low-level alerting

512
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,280
had a really great one, but it's very,

513
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:01,039
very simple. Here's how effectively it

514
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:03,679
works, right? It says it lets attackers

515
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,960
bypass authentication. Uh maybe this

516
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,400
will be it. But here, let me let me just

517
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
give you the the skinny of how it works.

518
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,480
It's very very simple. there exists some

519
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:15,200
sort of like X uh trust me bro header

520
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,720
that you could just add to a request and

521
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:21,679
if the middleware saw trust me bro it

522
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:24,000
would just go uh yeah we don't need to

523
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:26,480
run authentication on this request and

524
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:28,640
that was just out there the whole idea

525
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,120
was this uh the idea why this thing

526
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:33,200
exists to begin with uh dev's doing

527
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,480
security am I right the reason why this

528
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:37,520
existed is that you have some sort of

529
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,360
HTTP request coming in right uh and Then

530
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
it goes into your system. Well, then you

531
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:43,600
have middleware that goes off and does a

532
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:46,000
request cuz everything is like

533
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,679
microservices and all this stuff to go

534
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,120
and see are you authenticated? That

535
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:52,640
authentication needs to make a request

536
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,400
that needs to pass through middleware

537
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:56,240
again apparently like apparently this is

538
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,799
how people have things set up. So then

539
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:02,559
it would then do this thing forever. So

540
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,120
their way around that was x trust me bro

541
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,720
and bro would be like ah trust you and

542
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,880
you just pass right through the

543
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,480
middleware and just keep on going or you

544
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,120
pass right through the authentication uh

545
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:14,440
middleware like that's it was SSA. Yeah.

546
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:19,000
Super secure

547
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:22,160
authentication. Trust me, bro. True.

548
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:24,360
True. Right. That's insane. I mean, it's

549
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,000
it's a thing. It's just it it just

550
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:30,799
happened. Um, is it a is it is it is it

551
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:33,360
that crazy? It's really not that crazy.

552
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,200
There it is. X middleware sub request.

553
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,559
That's the trust me, bro. Right.

554
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,320
Everybody was clapping when someone

555
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:40,160
introduced this optimization. Exactly.

556
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,480
When someone solved this recursive

557
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,480
middleware request thing, everybody

558
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:49,919
clapped. Beautiful. Absolutely

559
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,760
beautiful. There's there's about 10 more

560
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,960
dozen examples of this uh of the same

561
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,080
type of attack. Oh, it exists

562
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,760
everywhere. Good answer. Good answer.

563
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,679
Right. And so it's just like remember

564
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,440
that was just fixed like a week ago in

565
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:05,600
Nex.js. That means there is a nonzero

566
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,320
chance that if you're doing security in

567
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:09,919
an AI's programming, things can happen.

568
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,600
You know, you might just accidentally

569
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,960
eat that snake's tail. When it comes to

570
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,480
security, you should be the person who

571
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:16,480
is responsible and understands this

572
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
fully. I've done that and I've also

573
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:19,200
introduced security problems. Critical

574
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,520
systems should be written and reviewed

575
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:23,280
by humans. And if we are heading to a

576
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,320
situation where one AI agent writes the

577
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:25,919
code and another reviews the

578
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,679
autogenerated PR and then another AI

579
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:30,240
agent deploys the code, we will see a

580
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:32,960
huge spike of security issues soon.

581
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:35,440
Absolutely. Like absolutely. By the way,

582
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:37,280
that was not a knock against Nex.js. Uh

583
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,840
for those that are wondering, this is

584
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,159
just why it's hard. Like security is

585
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:45,280
hard and things that seem like

586
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:47,039
reasonable solutions to somebody that

587
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,600
doesn't have the context of how things

588
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:50,880
work will go, "Wow, that's a reasonable

589
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,120
solution." Because you know, whoever

590
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,720
made that change, there was probably

591
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:57,280
somebody else that reviewed it and said,

592
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:59,600
"Oh, that's a good idea. Good answer,

593
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,039
Todd." Right? Like Todd made it like I'm

594
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,799
a genius. And then somebody else was

595
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:04,640
like, "Todd's a genius." Right? Like

596
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:07,520
there's multiple people that let this

597
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:10,799
thing go through. Who knows how many,

598
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:12,480
right? So, uh, let's see. As an XJS, uh,

599
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,000
NexJS user, it should have been a knock

600
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,720
on NextJS. It's not It's not a knock on

601
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,240
Next.js. It's just like that's the like

602
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:22,480
security is hard. Security it. Uh, what

603
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,320
what was it? Uh, Androl from the Black

604
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:27,760
Tower, Wheel of Time, book 14. Uh, boom.

605
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,120
Yeah, we're citing more Wheel of Time.

606
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:33,120
I'm just about to finish Wheel of Time.

607
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:35,440
Okay. uh someone uh the uh Pava was with

608
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:37,919
him and she's like all men are ignorant

609
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,240
and he said yes that's because not all

610
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,640
men can know everything and so everyone

611
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:46,080
is ignorant of something which is

612
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,760
awesome which is an awesome line you

613
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:50,000
it's just it's just simple ignorance on

614
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:52,080
security right it's not it's not it's I

615
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,159
it's not even a knock against him right

616
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,760
where I draw the line I still use AI

617
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:57,440
sometimes I think it can be a great tool

618
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,200
when used wisely I draw the line at

619
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,880
integrations I keep AI fully separate

620
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,720
from my code editor. So that's actually

621
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:04,159
my opposite take. If you're going to use

622
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,720
AI, you might as well have it in your

623
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:08,400
editor. Uh all of the context I add

624
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,559
manually. I intentionally keep the

625
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,600
effort required quite high. So it is uh

626
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,799
so it decentizes me. Interesting. Okay.

627
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:17,440
That's because you can't help yourself.

628
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:19,440
Okay. Yeah, I guess that makes sense. Um

629
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:21,760
let's see. Examples of where I use AI

630
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,640
for work include convert these go tests

631
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:26,880
instructs to tests in a map. Fair.

632
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:29,919
Convert this calculation to SIMD. This

633
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,880
is nuts. Uh, and when the content type

634
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,559
is application zlib, decode the body, I

635
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:36,240
have to set up some custom instructions

636
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,400
to only give me the code that has

637
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,320
changed and to give me instructions for

638
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,840
adding it. This way, I'm still the one

639
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,559
making the changes in the codebase. Just

640
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:46,559
approving a git diff is not enough. I

641
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,799
want to manually add the code myself.

642
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:51,200
Only then do I feel confident to sign

643
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:52,880
off it or off on it and take

644
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,240
responsibility for it. Yeah, I mean

645
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,760
there there is something to that where

646
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,760
you can get lost in the sauce of a git

647
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:59,520
diff. That's fair. You could get lost in

648
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,679
the sauce. That's that's fair. That

649
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,080
happens. It's easy to like That's why

650
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,960
when I do a review of code, I think it's

651
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:09,039
easier to do a review code on GitHub

652
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,559
than in my editor. Like even though I

653
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,400
know how to do diffs on my editor, I

654
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:14,640
know how to do all those things. I can

655
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,640
definitely look at stuff. I just look at

656
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,799
it differently when I'm on GitHub. Like

657
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:20,720
my my mind changes. I have this very

658
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,120
intense kind of thought process because

659
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,400
I've trained myself when I'm on a

660
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,760
website. I somehow just review it better

661
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,039
than when I'm in my editor. When I'm in

662
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,720
my editor, I just don't review it as

663
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:32,640
well. I don't know why. I can't explain

664
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,320
why. I don't think it's a UI problem. I

665
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,840
think it's a mentality problem for me. I

666
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:38,080
think it's just simply when I look at

667
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:39,520
it, I've adopted the mentality of I'm

668
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,360
reviewing and a lot different like

669
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,880
internal like it's like driving on the

670
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,480
highway. I don't think about it anymore,

671
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:46,080
but it's like it's like this automatic

672
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,200
process that comes up. I'm not even

673
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:50,000
trying to say it's good or bad. I'm just

674
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,159
saying it's just I get it. Another great

675
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,240
use case for AI is learning. I often

676
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,400
have questions that are quite uncommon

677
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,320
as I have a few very niche interests.

678
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
Turns out adding net code to a custom

679
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,240
game engine using ECS doesn't have a lot

680
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,919
of learning resources. What has worked

681
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,440
for me is asking the AI to explain

682
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:08,480
pieces of code like explain this

683
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:10,480
assembly code. Explain what this shader

684
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,640
does. Which books go in depth about

685
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:15,120
resolving client server desyncs in game

686
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,640
engines? The AI seems to struggle with

687
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,480
these sometimes. I'm getting mixed

688
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,320
results, but the results are still much

689
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:22,480
better than search engines. Yeah, I do

690
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:26,080
like uh AI as a search engine. I think

691
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:28,320
that I dude RIP Google or not even RIP,

692
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:31,520
you know, rest in rest in poop Google, I

693
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:33,679
dislike you. Uh I don't like Google at

694
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,440
all. Uh I will even use it for this

695
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:37,039
article though I'm not right. Let's see.

696
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,880
Though not for writing content, but for

697
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:40,960
checking like AI as search is pretty

698
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:42,799
great. I like AI. AI search very good.

699
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,880
Another benefit of using AI this way is

700
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:46,240
the cost. No unnecessary API calls,

701
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,159
manually managing context, and more

702
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,360
control over the LLM settings. I use a

703
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:51,679
desktop application with a bunch of

704
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:53,200
different LLMs hooked up to it. I have

705
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:54,799
used it daily for the last three months

706
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,960
or so and in total I have consumed

707
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,960
around $4 in credits. I don't want to

708
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,520
add let's see I do want to add that with

709
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
some things I am more strict on my

710
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,440
personal website. I don't have any AI

711
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:08,000
generated content whether that's text or

712
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,000
images. I don't like the AI generated

713
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,760
images or art personally for various

714
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,000
reasons and I think AI generated text

715
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,679
lacked character. It feels very flat and

716
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,279
boring when something is created by

717
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:21,919
humans. it it to me has more value than

718
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:23,039
uh when it's create created by AI. Yeah,

719
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,799
that's fair. I think a lot of people

720
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,200
feel that way. So, I I'm I'm on this

721
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:31,679
team. I'm I'm on that team. AI is

722
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:33,279
stealing uh artist jobs is brain rot.

723
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,279
It's not I I don't think it's brain rot.

724
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:36,960
I think AI is going to take artist jobs

725
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,080
for sure. I think a lot of people like I

726
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,080
can't tell you how many people that just

727
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,279
need like small icons or potions for

728
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,120
their games and stuff like that and

729
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,480
they'll just generate it uh and just

730
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,840
kind of walk away with it. especially a

731
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,240
lot of indie stuff, stuff that's only

732
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,840
ran by one person. Totally can see that

733
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,679
consuming a lot of like what used to

734
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,480
have to be, well, I won't have good art

735
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:56,400
unless if I have an artist. Uh I I think

736
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,320
it's going to happen, but again, I think

737
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,840
that's that's because it's it's again

738
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,600
measuring the wrong thing, which at the

739
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,679
end of the day, it's about measuring the

740
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,360
output. Like we could have generated all

741
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:07,520
the

742
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:09,919
towers, all the tiles, all the dirt and

743
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,640
everything for our tower defense game,

744
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:14,159
but instead we had Adam see Ununice. You

745
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,240
may have heard of him. amazing pixel

746
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:18,559
artist guy come and join us at the tower

747
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,400
and he was there he was talking he was

748
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,880
coming up with ideas he was making great

749
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,200
art the art is so coherent through all

750
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,200
the pieces of art that it's much much

751
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,720
better and that's because it's not

752
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,320
created in a vacuum it's created

753
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,400
holistically from one person so there's

754
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:34,240
like a theme and a feel that's really

755
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,000
really amazing and this is of course me

756
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:38,320
not touching on any of the topics around

757
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,159
like copyright licenses and all that I

758
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:42,000
think that's going to be an entire like

759
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,600
I think the next five years we will see

760
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,600
some pretty serious

761
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,880
issues when it comes to AI and that

762
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,360
don't steal Adam from releasing his

763
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:50,960
game. I only used him for a week or 5

764
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,559
days. So, it's very very little and he's

765
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,640
already in America and he was already

766
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:57,039
traveling for GDC. So, it's not it's

767
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:59,240
it's not a lot, right? I think I think

768
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:01,760
uh AI is going to have a lot of a lot of

769
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,440
problems uh when it comes to uh when it

770
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,120
comes to stuff. It's theft. It's fraud.

771
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,400
Plain and simple. Many AI arguments are

772
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
not technical. They are legal. Some

773
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:10,240
people see some people companies

774
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:11,600
understand and only uh let's see only

775
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,799
the stick or some people's company only

776
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:14,320
understand with the stick. I'm not sure

777
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,720
if that's true. I'm not sure how much of

778
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,360
it is legal or not legal. Uh I think

779
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,279
that there's plenty of public uh public

780
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:23,200
domain images that you can train off of.

781
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:25,279
There's also uh AI programs that are

782
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:28,720
trained off of artists who opt in and

783
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,440
give their styles. Um and so like that's

784
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,440
that's a thing people do that. And so

785
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,480
that's real. Also, I think this is I

786
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,919
think this is a very interesting

787
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,919
argument that we have to come to terms

788
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,760
with, which is legal don't matter to to

789
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,720
China, right? There's there's a lot of

790
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,559
things that you're going to have to kind

791
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,880
of think about in the future. I don't

792
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:46,559
think it's a I I think there's a lot of

793
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,799
reckoning and a lot of laws that are

794
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:50,720
about to happen. I just don't know what,

795
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:52,240
how, where, and how do you approach it.

796
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,640
It's just more very interesting. All

797
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,320
right. It is also worth noting that

798
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,919
there are more things to think about

799
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,679
than efficiency and productivity. It's

800
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,120
also about doing what you love. If you

801
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:02,640
love coding, keep doing it yourself,

802
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:04,399
even if the computer might be better at

803
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,440
it. True. And if you like making

804
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,640
products and you don't really like

805
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,919
coding, then it's probably better to

806
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,000
trade-off to use something that makes

807
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,000
the code for you. Right? In 1997, Deep

808
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:14,799
Blue won the chess match against the

809
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,039
world chess champion Gary Kaspor uh

810
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:19,600
Kasporov. Yet people still play chess.

811
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:21,279
When it comes to programming, I' I'd say

812
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,799
that I program for the same reasons that

813
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:24,080
people still play chess. Though chess

814
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,440
and software development are very

815
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:27,480
different with chess being much more

816
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,799
limited in

817
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:33,039
scope. True. Uh I love just dunking on

818
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,480
chess. Um, I think it is good to keep in

819
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,200
mind that sometimes we can do things

820
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,640
just to enjoy them. True. My advice to

821
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:40,320
new program, I like this statement, by

822
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:41,600
the way. This is a good statement. You

823
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,520
can just do things because you like

824
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,440
them. There doesn't have to be some sort

825
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,520
of monetizing outcome to it. And you

826
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,000
know what the best part is? Sometimes

827
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,919
monetization happens at the end. Like

828
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,760
good things happen at the end, but it

829
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,000
doesn't have to be the strict motivation

830
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:57,840
for it. My advice to new programmers,

831
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,279
don't become a forever junior who lets

832
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:00,480
AI do all their work. If you want to

833
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,840
become a programmer, learn to program

834
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,679
yourself. Be curious. Just let's see.

835
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,679
Put in the time and effort to learn how

836
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:08,240
things really work. Yeah. TJC course on

837
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:09,760
boot.dev. My HTTP course on boot.dev.

838
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:11,679
Just saying. Good ways to start learning

839
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,000
some backbone stuff and how things work

840
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,520
in the layer below that. It really pays

841
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,360
off. Learning how everything works under

842
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,279
the hood. And using that is amazing.

843
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:20,640
Just keep learning. Don't be a prompt

844
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:22,720
engineer. Even if you call that

845
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:24,159
engineering, believe me, it's more fun

846
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:27,279
to be competent. I love this term.

847
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:30,240
That's by That's a DHH one. DH DHH. DHH.

848
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:33,360
DHH. Yep. Boom.

849
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,919
It is just more fun to be competent.

850
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:37,760
Let's go.

851
00:29:34,919 --> 00:29:40,320
DHH. Let's go. He's a fact. Fact of

852
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:42,000
life. It is more fun to be competent.

853
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,840
Called it. Oh yeah. That's because that

854
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,760
is like that was like the greatest it

855
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:48,960
was the greatest interview of all time.

856
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:51,520
DHH is just a just a legend, right? Just

857
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:53,440
an absolute legend. Even though AI might

858
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,880
be smarter than you. I don't think it is

859
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:56,159
that I don't think you can use the term

860
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,919
smarter. It's not smarter. It's not

861
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:59,919
dumber or smarter than you. Never

862
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:02,240
blindly trust the AI output. Don't build

863
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,080
your whole workflow around it. Sometimes

864
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,000
try to work uh without it for a few

865
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:07,440
days. I like the airplane test. If you

866
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,240
can't program what you're doing on an

867
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:12,399
airplane, I you don't know it. Like if

868
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,720
you can't turn off the internet, sit on

869
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:16,480
an airplane, sit uncomfortably, be taken

870
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,080
completely out of your workplace, work

871
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,279
on a little laptop computer, and you

872
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,799
can't be efficient in work. I don't

873
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,799
think you have a good setup. The better

874
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,240
at programming you are, the more AI will

875
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:26,080
get in your way for the more complex

876
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,360
work. If you learn to code now, keep

877
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,440
building your skills instead of letting

878
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,200
AI do all the heavy lifting. You are

879
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:33,120
capable of fixing the messes that vibe

880
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,720
coding is now creating. I don't want to

881
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,559
sound elitist, but if you don't want to

882
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:38,720
learn to go beyond vibe coding, maybe

883
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:41,039
coding isn't for you because positions

884
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,120
where all work can be done by vibe

885
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,720
coding are the ones that will be

886
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:49,360
eliminated first when AI becomes more

887
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:50,559
powerful. Also true. Good trueing right

888
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:53,520
there. That's actually a pretty

889
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,799
hilarious observation. Vibe coding vibe

890
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,799
coders will be the first to be

891
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,520
eliminated as they get more as they get

892
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,520
more powerful. if and remember if you

893
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,600
cannot code without AI you cannot code

894
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,200
also great statement but I do mean that

895
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,480
the airplane thing I I don't say that as

896
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,080
like some sort of jer like oh you just

897
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,399
don't understand how to program it's

898
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,080
because your best thoughts will come

899
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,440
when you are limited and you're just

900
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:14,799
sitting there and you're just thinking

901
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,159
nothing's interrupting you nothing's

902
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:18,159
writing code for you nothing is doing

903
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,840
anything for you it's just you your

904
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,120
computer you're trying something you're

905
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:23,360
thinking you're trying something you're

906
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,960
thinking it's completely blank of all

907
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:27,200
other distractions and all of a sudden

908
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,799
you'll come up with like your best ideas

909
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
and that's because you've actually had

910
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:32,880
time to allow inspiration to happen. You

911
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,120
cannot be inspired when you're

912
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:37,600
constantly interrupted, right? It's just

913
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,600
like the constant forever. It just

914
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:41,200
doesn't work. Honestly, I I' I've always

915
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,039
hated that. I've always hated that

916
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:44,360
argument. Oh, well, just you got like,

917
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:46,640
you know, the

918
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:49,440
syntax is like the like what what do you

919
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:51,640
mean? If syntax is the barrier for you

920
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,360
to understand

921
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:59,519
programming, it's like brother, the

922
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:03,240
semantics is way harder. It's way, way,

923
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:05,519
way, way harder than the syntax.

924
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,440
Universally, all modern languages give

925
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:10,640
you great output when you goof something

926
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,880
up. Okay, shots fired at CO. I That's

927
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:14,960
why I said modern. Okay, this dude got

928
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:17,039
one guy hard. I did, but I but it's just

929
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:18,559
like such a common one guying. It's such

930
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:20,080
a common one that people say this

931
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,240
constantly like, "Oh, something about

932
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:24,640
syntax." And I always just get so blown

933
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,640
away that syntax is the barrier. Like

934
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,320
syntax is just not the barrier. It's not

935
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:32,159
hard. Anyways, conclusion. When you're

936
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,919
using AIS, you are sacrificing knowledge

937
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:35,519
for speed. Sometimes it's worth making

938
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:36,960
the trade-off. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.

939
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,480
You should know when to do that. I think

940
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,159
this article is a little heavy-handed on

941
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,440
when you should and shouldn't do it. Um,

942
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,720
I think that you just got to figure out

943
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,399
what you like the best and the reasons

944
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,720
why you program. At the end of the day,

945
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:48,000
I don't think there's a solid answer. I

946
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,440
don't think there's like I don't look

947
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,039
down on the person that just vibe codes

948
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:52,720
everything. I just wouldn't I just

949
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,159
wouldn't work on their projects. And if

950
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,799
someone's like, "Here's $1,000. Could

951
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,840
you fix a bug?" I'd say no. I just I I

952
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,279
don't want to be I don't I don't even

953
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,840
want to be a part of it. Unless if I can

954
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:03,120
prompt my way also and spend uh 30

955
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:04,240
minutes doing it or else I don't want

956
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,279
anything to do with your code. Like your

957
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,720
code is trash and I don't want anything

958
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:08,159
to do with it. That's it. Right? I don't

959
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,760
want to have to deal with your crap.

960
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:11,919
Right? I'm more on the implication side

961
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,440
of things. as long as you're long as at

962
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,720
the end of the day the code looks good

963
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,080
and you've done a good

964
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,679
job like I don't care how you made it

965
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:23,760
right. Uh though it is important to

966
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:25,200
remember that even the best athletes in

967
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:27,279
the world are still doing their basic

968
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,279
drills for for a reason. Yes. Yes. This

969
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:30,480
is good. Uh the same applies to software

970
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,240
development. You need to practice the

971
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,320
basics to be able to do the advanced

972
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,840
work. You need to keep your axe sharp.

973
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:37,600
We are still a long way out from AI

974
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:40,000
taking over our jobs. A lot of companies

975
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,840
are creating FOMO as a sales tactic to

976
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,600
get more customers and or raise money to

977
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:45,519
show traction to their investors to get

978
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,720
another round of funding to generate the

979
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,039
next model that will definitely

980
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,360
revolutionize

981
00:33:48,039 --> 00:33:56,080
everything. AI is a tool. It is not good

982
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:56,080
or bad in itself. It's what you do with

983
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:01,200
it. You know, they say it's not the size

984
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:03,519
of the tool that matters. It's not the

985
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:05,840
size of the parameters that matter. Uh I

986
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,519
do think it can be a great tool as long

987
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,520
as you are not reliant on it for your

988
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:11,119
workflow. Uh make sure you still can

989
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,480
work effectively without it. Make sure

990
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:14,079
you don't push code to production that

991
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,679
you don't fully understand and don't

992
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:17,040
think of AI as a replacement for your

993
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,560
own thinking. Stay curious, keep

994
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,119
learning. I think this is one thing that

995
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,119
uh cursor did really really well which

996
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:25,200
is like I think Devon made the big

997
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:27,599
mistake and I think cursor did not make

998
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,960
the big mistake. Cursor goes engineers

999
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:31,599
are going to be around. We're going to

1000
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,040
make it easy to use AI. Devon said,

1001
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,079
"Engineers aren't going to be around.

1002
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:36,399
We're going to replace them. We're going

1003
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:38,399
to make it easy for you to to use LLMs."

1004
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:40,399
And they're two distinct schools of

1005
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,679
thought. The Devon one, I think, is

1006
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:45,599
built and predicated on this idea that

1007
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,480
AI is going to improve at this really

1008
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:52,240
crazy rate. Cursor is built on this idea

1009
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:54,639
that increased conveniences will make

1010
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:57,440
you use it more, but you are still the

1011
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,280
one in control. I think Devon ultimately

1012
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:00,839
is not going to be successful unless if

1013
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,839
there is an

1014
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:05,200
intense change in the power of LLM to

1015
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:07,359
the point where it actually makes it

1016
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,720
possible to vive code uniformly for all

1017
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:13,520
problems or B cursor is going to be the

1018
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,000
success because it has the good tabbing

1019
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,920
it has

1020
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,200
uh it has better integration and a lot

1021
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,200
of people are going to just rely on it

1022
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,400
for a lot of

1023
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,640
coding right Devon got replaced by AI

1024
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:29,599
unironically Devon got replaced by AI.

1025
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,520
All right. Hey, I like the article. I I

1026
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:34,079
really I I really did like the uh the

1027
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,880
Tesla one and just the emphasis on a lot

1028
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:38,240
of small pract like a lot of practicing

1029
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,760
the little things make you good at the

1030
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,520
big things. And I think that that's the

1031
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:42,560
shortcut a lot of people want to find. I

1032
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,320
think this is just like you see it in

1033
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,000
kids. If anyone in here has raised kids,

1034
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:48,320
it's the number one problem of a lot of

1035
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,320
kids is that the small things they don't

1036
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:52,320
want to do. It's the big thing. People

1037
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,920
always want to do the big thing. Why can

1038
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:55,200
I not do the big thing? Why can I not

1039
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,720
lead the big thing? Why can't I do that?

1040
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:58,800
You know, but if you watch Euro Dreams

1041
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,560
of Sushi, the people that he brings on

1042
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:02,800
to help make the world's greatest sushi

1043
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:05,040
have to spend three years making rice.

1044
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,720
Just making rice. That is it. Because to

1045
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,200
understand the process in the most

1046
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,320
intimate possible way, you have to do

1047
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:14,400
something over and over and over and

1048
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,160
over and over and over and over again

1049
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:17,520
until the point where you just get it so

1050
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,599
deeply that it's like a completely

1051
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,240
different understanding of what you get.

1052
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:24,160
And so therefore, it's a message lost on

1053
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:25,839
a lot of people because people don't get

1054
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,000
that there's layers of knowledge.

1055
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:30,079
There's not just knowing the thing.

1056
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,720
There's like a deeper knowing the thing

1057
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:34,320
and why it's good, but not just simply I

1058
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,720
like some things I know about

1059
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:39,119
programming I cannot write into a book.

1060
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:41,440
You cannot write into a book. It just

1061
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:43,040
exists. It exists within you. And even

1062
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:45,680
if you try to write them down, it's

1063
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:48,119
never going to come out correct. the

1064
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:50,560
name is I feel like I was halfway

1065
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:52,400
through my sentence and I stopped. Yeah,

1066
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:54,079
it's intuition is the is the term you're

1067
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:56,960
looking for, but it's like it's it's

1068
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:59,839
more than intuition. It's it's also it's

1069
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:01,440
like it's these sequential logical jumps

1070
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:03,839
with the gaps being filled in by

1071
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,440
intuition. So, it's not just simply, oh,

1072
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:07,200
I think this is better. It's like this

1073
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,480
is better because if I think about this

1074
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,680
next thing, I think this will be better

1075
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
here and then if I think about the next

1076
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,119
thing, the next thing. It's like playing

1077
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,280
chess on top of programming that makes

1078
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:17,040
it end up so good. It's not just one

1079
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
simple jump. It's the many jumps in

1080
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:24,960
between. Right. Anyways, it's finger

1081
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,960
spits and fragle. Yes, exactly.
